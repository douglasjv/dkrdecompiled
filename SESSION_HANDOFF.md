- Branch: `master`
- HEAD: `a3c2b59b`
- Completed task: `func_8002B0F4`
- Summary: Rejected collision-plane scalar boolean guard spelling; source changed only tempVec4f.y != 0.0 to tempVec4f.y.

## Validation

- gmake -j4 CROSS=tools/binutils/mips64-elf- Verify: OK; ./score.sh -s 97.30%; python3 tools/check_active_surface.py active surface ok

## Blockers Or Unknowns

- No open blockers recorded.

## Ask The User Only If

- The retail baserom or extracted assets are missing.
- A required setup dependency cannot be installed or initialized.
- A behavior question cannot be resolved from code, symbols, or focused diff evidence.

## Next Work Packet

- Task: `Run selector; func_80049794 remains recommended but saturated, so use a distinct independent source family or pivot to another active routable candidate.`
- Packet class: `matching_impl`
- Packet status: `ready`
- Reasoning tier: `medium`
- Step: Run `python3 tools/query_goal_state.py next --compact --refresh`, inspect the selected source/asm pair, write ordinary C, diagnose with `./diff.sh <function>`, and accept only after `gmake -j4 CROSS=tools/binutils/mips64-elf-` verifies the matching ROM.
