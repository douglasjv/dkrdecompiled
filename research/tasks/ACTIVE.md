# Active Matching Surface

## Goal Context

- End goal: every original Diddy Kong Racing function has source-level C that
  keeps the matching ROM byte-identical.
- Loop: `research/tasks/GOAL_LOOP.md`.
- Selector: `python3 tools/query_goal_state.py next --compact --refresh`.
- Parked packets: `research/tasks/PARKED.md`; the selector skips parked
  function names.
- Default work: bounded `matching_impl` packets against one `GLOBAL_ASM`,
  `NON_MATCHING`, or `NON_EQUIVALENT` target.
- Default validation: `gmake -j4 CROSS=tools/binutils/mips64-elf-` in matching
  mode, then focused `./diff.sh` only for diagnosis.

## Current Route

- First route: run the selector and start with its `recommended_next`.
- Current repository baseline from README: `us.v77` reports 97.30% decompiled,
  with 7 `GLOBAL_ASM`, 4 `NON_MATCHING`, and 3 `NON_EQUIVALENT` functions.
- Current selector surface after parking `func_8008FF1C` and
  `func_80017A18`: 5 active guarded candidates, 2 parked candidates.
  Recommended next packet is `init_particle_buffers` in `src/particles.c`.
- The baserom lives at `baseroms/baserom.us.v77.z64`, has SHA1
  `0cb115d8716dbbc2922fda38e533b9fe63bb9670`, and should remain untracked.
- This checkout needs repo-local binutils for the matching gate. Plain
  `gmake -j4` selects Homebrew `mips-linux-gnu-ld` and fails linking
  `build/src/objects.c.o` with an invalid `.strtab` offset.

## Matching Lessons

- `NON_MATCHING=1` builds are useful for behavior experiments but are not the
  acceptance gate for matching packets.
- Matching mode uses IDO and `std=gnu90`; keep source compatible with the
  existing compiler path.
- Prefer exact type width, signedness, volatile use, expression order, early
  return shape, and local variable lifetime before broad rewrites.
- If a source probe does not improve the focused diff, record the source-shape
  family in the handoff instead of retrying it blindly.
- `func_8008FF1C` is parked in `research/tasks/PARKED.md`: matching-mode
  promotion currently fails on a `v1` vs `t2` selected-track halfword
  load/branch after `level_name`, while broader local-order/branch probes
  cascade register allocation. Do not retry those same probes as the next
  packet.
- `func_80017A18` is parked in `research/tasks/PARKED.md`: existing C compiles
  when promoted, but diff evidence points at frame size, saved-register
  allocation, and float-temp lifetime mismatches. Do not retry the recorded
  dead-local, edge-plane-inline, or `register var_s6` probes as the next
  packet.

## Ask The User Only If

- The retail baserom or extracted assets are missing.
- A required setup dependency cannot be installed or initialized.
- A behavior question cannot be resolved from code, symbols, or focused diff
  evidence.
